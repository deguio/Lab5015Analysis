### Login to your favourite machine
```sh
ssh username@hostname
```



### Fresh installation of the analysis package
```sh
export MYNAME=putYourNameHere  #use your name for development
mkdir $MYNAME
cd $MYNAME
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Lab5015/Lab5015Analysis
cd Lab5015Analysis
source scripts/setup.sh
make
make exe
```


### Package structure
This package is structured as follows
- Utilities are organized in the `interface` and `src` folders:
    - `interface`: contains the class or functions headers
    - `src`: contains the class or functions implementation
- `main`: contains the main analysis code that make use of the Utilities
- `cfg`: contains the config files which are used to pass parameters to the executables

After the compilation, each step of the analysis can be executed from the main folder `Lab5015Analysis` with a command like:
`./bin/executable cfg/configfile`



### Before running the analysis
The output filename and output location of each analysis step are defined in the cfg files. Before running the analysis make sure you have checked and if needed updated the relevant output paths in order not to overwrite the work of others.

Other than that, every time you login remember to source the setup script:
```
cd Lab5015Analysis
source scripts/setup.sh
```


### Run the analysis
The analysis of the collected data is structured in three steps
1. `moduleCharacterization_step1.cpp`:
   This step performs the first loop over the events and fills base histograms such as energy and ToT for each bar, each theshold and each over-voltage. A skim of the events according to the selections defined in the config file is also performed. The output is in the form of TTrees and histograms.

1. `moduleCharacterization_step2.cpp`:
   This step performs several loops over the events:
    1. loop over the histos filled in step1 and define the energy ranges
    1. loop over the skimmed TTrees and fill raw distribution of energy and energy ratio according to the predefined bins
    1. loop over the skimmed TTrees and compute time walk corrections
    1. loop over the skimmed TTrees and apply the time walk corrections
    
   The output of this step are histograms.

1. `moduleCharacterization_step3.cpp`:
   This step is still missing. The idea here is to run over the histograms filled in step2 and produce summary plots. Loops over the events don't belong to here.



### Visualize the results
All the results are available for inspection on a website hosted on pcfatis. The [link](http://pcfatis.mib.infn.it) is accessible from the INFN network or via tunnel.
